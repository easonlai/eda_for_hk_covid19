# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong

Around half a year ago, I shared a code repository about [Data Analysis of COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong](https://github.com/easonlai/covid19_hk_analysis) to demonstrate data analytics with Python packages ([Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)). Time is going fast. That's around May 2020, and it's the beginning of the wave 4 COVID-19 outbreak in Hong Kong. In a previous analysis, interesting patterns are being figured out from the statistical analysis.

So sad that another new wave of COVID-19 is rising in Hong Kong again, a variation of COVID-19, Omicron. With half a year more data, I have created a new EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and trying to figure out the new interesting patterns from statistical analysis.

I hope you enjoy this sample of EDA for COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong as an analytics reference. God bless our Hong Kong, keep hygiene, and stay safe.

This is a code sample of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for COVID-19 cases in Hong Kong. Data is obtained from the official [data.gov.hk](https://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-dh-chpsebcddr-novel-infectious-agent).
